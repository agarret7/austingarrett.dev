I am a recently-hired AI software engineer at IBM. Before that I was a Masterâ€™s student in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, advised by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/) in the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/). During my undergraduate in Computer Science and Physics at MIT, I was a part of the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu/) under [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), where I researched deep neural network techniques for program induction and physical intuition. I also worked for the self-driving car startup [ISEE](https://www.isee.ai/), where I developed deep neural networks for object detection on 3D point cloud data.
