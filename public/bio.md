I am a probabilistic programmer, systems engineer, and open-source developer.

My last role was a research engineer at MIT-IBM, supporting DARPA's Machine Common Sense (MCS) mission. Before that I was a Masterâ€™s student in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, advised by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/) in the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/). During my undergraduate in Computer Science and Physics at MIT, I was a part of the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu/) directed by [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), where I researched applications of neural networks to program induction and models of intuitive physics. I also did an internship with the self-driving car startup [ISEE](https://www.isee.ai/), where I implemented point-based vision algorithms for online object detection using LIDAR.

These days I'm interested in: low-level probabilistic languages, decentralized semi-parametric insurance, and autonomous vehicles.  I occasionally put new things up on my [blog](blog).
